<p>My name is Kalib Hubbard, I use he/him/his pronouns, I’m 20 years old, and I am a bicycle mechanic and graphic designer based out of Richmond VA. I am currently working on getting my bachelors degree in graphic design from Virginia Commonwealth University. I have been involved with cycling since I started cross country mountain bike racing at 14 and have been working as a mechanic since I was 17.</p>

<p>I was born and raised in Athens Georgia, a small town not too far from Atlanta, known for its arts and music scene, as well as being the home of The University of Georgia. I was raised by two very artistic parents, surrounded by countless other artists and creatives which I believe helped me kindle my passion for the arts. I have always loved creating but it wasn’t til my sophomore year of highschool that I discovered my affinity for digital art and graphic design.</p>

<p>Thanks for checking out my website!</p>
